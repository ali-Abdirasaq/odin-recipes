    <h1>Chicken Parmesan Grilled Cheese</h1>
    <img src="./SandWitch.jpg">  
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Wanted to eat a chicken Parmesan sub but didn't feel like spending the time cooking and breading chicken. 
        So I opted to cut corners using frozen chicken patties and pre-prepared ingredients to make my life easier. 
        Picked up the sub rolls and couldn't justify eating that many calories,
        so opted instead for sliced Italian bread and thin-sliced cheese. Turned out so surprisingly good, I thought I'd share. Enjoy!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 frozen breaded chicken patties (such as Tyson®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic butter, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices Italian bread</li>
        <li>1 cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>6 thin slices provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place chicken patties on a baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and crispy, about 20 minutes. Cut chicken patties in half lengthwise. </li>
        <li>Spread garlic butter onto 1 side of each bread slice. </li>
        <li>Mix marinara sauce, basil, and garlic salt together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until warmed, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir. </li>
        <li>
            <p> 
                Place 1 bread slice, butter-side down, into a skillet; top with 2 slices provolone cheese, 
                1 tablespoon marinara sauce, 2 chicken patty halves, overlapped to cover bread, 
                2 tablespoons marinara sauce, 1 slice provolone cheese, and bread, butter-side up. 
                Cook over medium heat until bread is crisp and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over remaining marinara sauce and serve alongside each sandwich. </li>
    </ol>
